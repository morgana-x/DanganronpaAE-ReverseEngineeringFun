# Danganronpa-Another-Episode-ReverseEngineering

Just some fun stuff while I prepare for an overly ambitious project for the game in my own time, feel free to use whatever, pwease credit though!!1! :)

This all hacky code, not meant to be a finished product

Start the application AFTER you have started the game


# Noclipping
Press V when inside a level to toggle noclip, WASD Spacebar LeftShift to move

# Console Commands
+ setammo [0-7] [amount] (-1 to disable, -2 for infinite, otherwise 0 to whatever short overflow is)
+ sethp [amount]
+ infhp (toggles infinite health)
+ spawn (CRASHES game right now)
+ quit (really unessecary)
+ setcoins [amount] (set monocoins)
+ up (test command that teleports all entitys upwards by 10 unites
+ tp (teleports all objects to komaru)
